# ML Project (year 21/22)

This repository contains the code for the ML project of the course of Machine Learning of University of Rome Tor Vergata.

## What is this project about?

`TODO`

### Installed Features

Same as the [template repository](https://github.com/Effibot/dockgpu-template) plus scikit-learn and tensorflow with GPU support.

### Notes

To test if the container is working properly run the `tf_test.py` script. with:

`python tf_test.py`

This will run a simple tensorflow script created assembling the lines of tensorflow quickstart guide.

---

Inside the `Dockerfile` there are commented lines that can be used to install necessary packages to compile tensorflow from source. This is useful if you want to use a different version of tensorflow or if you want to use a different version of CUDA and other NVIDIA libraries.
